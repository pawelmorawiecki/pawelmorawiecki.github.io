# Pawe≈Ç Morawiecki

I am an associate professor at the [Institute of Computer Science](https://ipipan.waw.pl/), Polish Academy of Sciences, where I am a head of the cryptography group. Currently, my main research interest is at the intersection between security and deep learning. Previously, I was more involved in cryptography, cryptanalysis and logic synthesis.
